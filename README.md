#TODO:

   Usability:
      - Delay nav or retry loading when creating a new listing or nft to give indexer time to update
      - Check if opted into app before trying to create listing
      - Check if opted into asset before trying to create, give option?
      - Convert prices to bignum

   Listing:
      - Add up to N tags as part of listing

   Tagging:
      - Add batched tagging 
   
   Price:
      - Change price UI

   Wallets:
      - Add support for other wallets

   Minting:

      - Write raw file bytes into json metadata file?

   Browse:
      - Add filters on browse page for tags/price
