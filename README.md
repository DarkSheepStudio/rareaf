Rare AF is _your_ NFT Marketplace

- Fork this repo and configure it
- Publish it on Cloudflare or Fleek
- Mint NFTs, Exhibit them, List them for sale, Host others
- Profit?


*huh?*

You own the platform, decide who has access and can customize its appearance. 

Rare AF showrooms let you display your digital assets.  Showrooms can be personal collections you want to exhibit. Or you can choose to list your assets for sale. You can also choose to host curated guest collections as an exhibibition or for sale. 


*how much tho?*

Fork it for free, configure it, publish it on a static hosting site. Then you set fees on the works that sell.

#TODO:

   Initialization:
      - Create Tokens/App 
      - Update Config on Github

   General:
      - Delay nav or retry loading when creating a new listing or nft to give indexer time to update, use bp3-skeleton class
      - Check if opted into app before trying to create listing
      - Check if opted into asset before trying to create, give option?
      - Convert numbers to bignum
      - Cache tag names/ids so we dont have to hit the net every time


   Wallets:
      - Add support for other wallets

   Minting:
      - Add more fields for metadata
      - Write raw file bytes into json metadata file?

   Browse:
      - Add filters on browse page for tags/price
